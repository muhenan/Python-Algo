    LeetCode 2571: Minimum Operations to Reach a Number
    (From Weekly Contest 333)
    
    Given a positive integer n, in one operation you can:
    1. Add or subtract a power of 2 (2^x) from n
    Find the minimum number of operations to reduce n to 0.
    
    Example:
    Input: n = 54
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    54 -> (54-32=22) -> (22-16=6) -> (6-4=2) -> (2-2=0)
